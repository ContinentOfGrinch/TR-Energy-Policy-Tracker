# karbon-atlasi-turkiye

**A facility-level atlas of Türkiye's carbon-intensive infrastructure.**

An open-source R Shiny atlas that maps 300 individual installations — 88 industrial plants
in the EU CBAM sectors and 212 energy assets — and assembles the evidence linking them:
the grid carbon intensity that industrial indirect emissions depend on, and the fleet that
produces it.

> ### What works today, and what does not
>
> **Built and verified:** the acquisition pipeline with a full provenance chain, the
> coverage audit that fixes `t₀` empirically, the 300-facility register with province and
> İBBS-2 assignment, commissioning years from GEM, three cross-validated estimates of grid
> carbon intensity, the **1,800-row facility × year emissions panel** (2021–2026), and an
> interactive map of both populations.
>
> **Not built:** the CBAM liability calculation, and the time slider that the panel now
> makes possible. The panel's `co2_direct_t` and `co2_indirect_t` columns are deliberately
> empty pending the direct/indirect decomposition, which is a modelling decision and not a
> parsing one. The regulatory parameters are in place and cited. See
> [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
>
> **This tool does not yet produce a CBAM exposure figure.** When it does, this paragraph
> will say so.

## Türkçe özet

Bu proje, Türkiye'nin karbon yoğun altyapısını **tesis düzeyinde** haritalayan açık
kaynaklı bir R Shiny atlasıdır. Birbirinden ayrı incelenen iki popülasyonu ve aralarındaki
bağı bir araya getirir:

- **88 sanayi tesisi** — demir-çelik, çimento, alüminyum (SKDM sektörleri)
- **212 enerji varlığı** — 157 elektrik santrali, 38 kömür ocağı, 17 petrol-gaz tesisi

Bağ şudur: sanayi tesislerinin **dolaylı** emisyonu, tükettikleri elektriğin karbon
yoğunluğuna bağlıdır; o yoğunluğu da haritalanabilir bir filo üretir.

**Bugün ne var, ne yok.** Veri boru hattı, tesis kütüğü, devreye giriş yılları, şebeke
yoğunluğunun üç bağımsız tahmini ve harita çalışıyor. **SKDM maruziyet hesabı, emisyon
paneli ve zaman slider'ı henüz yok** — gerekli mevzuat parametreleri hazır ve kaynaklı,
ama dayandıkları modelleme kararları verilmedi.

**Önemli — bu araç bir vergi hesaplayıcısı değildir.** SKDM sertifikalarını AB'deki
ithalatçı satın alır, Türk üretici değil. Hesap eklendiğinde üretilecek rakam, tesisin
AB'ye giden üretimine gömülü emisyonun yarattığı **maliyet baskısı** olacaktır — tesise
kesilecek bir fatura değil. Bu maliyetin ne kadarının üreticiye yansıyacağı bir pazarlık
gücü sorusudur ve bu modelin dışındadır.

Tüm emisyon rakamları **modellenmiş tahmindir.** Türkiye'de tesis düzeyinde doğrulanmış
sera gazı raporları kamuya açık değildir.

## Why this exists

Existing analyses of Turkish CBAM exposure work at national or sectoral resolution. That
is enough to say "Turkish steel is exposed"; it is not enough to say *which plants, in
which provinces, by how much*. Regional development agencies, journalists and policymakers
need the second answer and cannot get it from an aggregate.

The contribution is the combination — facility-level, spatially explicit, open source,
with an audit trail from every displayed figure back to its inputs. The arithmetic itself
is commodity.

## Scope

### What is covered

| Dimension | Current |
|---|---|
| Industrial sectors | Iron & steel 27, cement 58, aluminium 3 — **88 facilities**, CO₂ basis |
| Energy assets | Electricity generation 157, coal mining 38, oil & gas 17 — **212 facilities**, CO₂e basis |
| Total | **300 records at 290 distinct locations** |
| Geography | Türkiye, facility → province → İBBS-2 region → national |
| Emissions years | 2021–2026 (`t₀ = 2021`, established empirically; 2026 partial at 5 months) |
| Commissioning years | **66% populated**, back to 1911, from GEM. Aluminium, refining and oil & gas are 0% because GEM publishes no tracker for them |
| Regime | EU CBAM |

**The two populations use different gas bases and are never summed.** CBAM is a CO₂
instrument, so industrial figures are CO₂. Only 18% of Turkish coal mining's footprint is
CO₂ — the rest is fugitive methane — so energy figures are CO₂e over 100 years. A total
spanning both would be meaningless, and the interface says so before the idea forms.

### What is not covered, and why

These are decisions with reasons, not gaps left by accident. Each is argued in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

- **Three of the six CBAM goods categories.** CBAM also covers fertilisers, electricity
  and hydrogen. Electricity and hydrogen are excluded by choice — Turkish electricity
  exports to the EU are marginal and hydrogen volumes negligible. **Fertilisers are
  excluded on evidence:** no open source publishes Turkish fertiliser-*production*
  facilities. Climate TRACE's similarly named `synthetic-fertilizer-application` covers
  N₂O from fertiliser applied to soils — a different emission source, and not what CBAM
  regulates.
- **Aluminium PFCs.** CBAM covers CO₂ *and* perfluorocarbons for aluminium. No PFC country
  package is published, so aluminium exposure computed here is an underestimate. The gap
  is flagged in the interface rather than filled.
- **No equilibrium modelling.** This is an accounting framework. No price elasticity, no
  substitution, no trade diversion. The claim is narrow and deliberate: *given this output
  and this emission intensity, liability under scenario X is Y.*

## Installation

Requires **R 4.5.1 or later**. Development and testing were done on Windows 11.

```r
# 1. Clone, then from the project root:
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()      # installs the exact package versions in renv.lock
```

`sf` needs GDAL, GEOS and PROJ. On Windows these ship with the CRAN binary. On Linux
install `libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev` first.

### Build the data

`data/raw/` is not committed — reproducibility comes from the fetch scripts, not from a
45 MB blob in git history. Run the pipeline in order:

```bash
Rscript scripts/00_coverage_audit.R      # availability evidence, fixes t₀
Rscript scripts/01_fetch_climate_trace.R # downloads sources, writes SOURCES.md
Rscript scripts/01b_fetch_eu_trade.R     # EU trade quantities from Eurostat Comext
Rscript scripts/01c_ingest_gem.R         # commissioning years — NEEDS A MANUAL STEP
Rscript scripts/01d_fetch_ember.R        # national generation, grid intensity
Rscript scripts/02_build_facilities.R    # builds facilities.rds
Rscript scripts/03_build_panel.R         # builds facility_panel.rds
```

On Windows use `Rscript`, not `R` — in PowerShell `R` collides with the `Invoke-History`
alias.

#### The one manual step

Everything else fetches itself. **`01c_ingest_gem.R` does not**, because Global Energy
Monitor distributes its trackers through a form rather than a download URL:

1. Download the **Global Integrated Power Tracker** workbook from
   [globalenergymonitor.org](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-integrated-power-tracker/download-data/)
2. Save it, unrenamed, into `data/raw/gem/`
3. Optionally add the **Global Coal Mine Tracker** workbook to the same folder

The script stops with these instructions if the file is absent; it never proceeds with an
empty table.

This step is here because the open alternative was measured and found unusable. WRI's
Global Power Plant Database downloads freely but populates `commissioning_year` for only
25 of 163 Turkish plants — 15% — and stops at 2017, reporting 695 MW of solar against a
real figure more than an order of magnitude larger. A fleet timeline built on that would
show 18 plants appearing while 145 stayed invisible. One manual download was the better
trade; the reasoning is recorded in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) under E2.

### Run the app

```r
shiny::runApp("app")
```

## Repository layout

```
app/          global.R, ui.R, server.R — the dashboard
data/raw/     downloaded sources (not tracked)
data/processed/  facilities.rds, coverage matrices, SOURCES.md
policies/     regulatory parameters as JSON, read at runtime
scripts/      numbered ETL pipeline plus _sources.R helpers
```

Regulatory parameters live in `policies/*.json` and are **never hardcoded in R**. This is
not a style preference: TR-ETS secondary legislation was still being finalised through
mid-2026 and CBAM certificate prices update quarterly. If maintenance required editing R
source, this project would be dead within two years.

**No ShareAlike anywhere in the chain**, which is why geoBoundaries was rejected for
province boundaries: its Turkey layer is CC BY-SA 2.0 and ShareAlike would have propagated
into this project's CC BY 4.0 derived data.

Full provenance — release tags, SHA-256 digests, retrieval dates and the complete
attribution chain — is in [SOURCES.md](data/processed/SOURCES.md),
[SOURCES_GEM.md](data/processed/SOURCES_GEM.md) and
[SOURCES_EMBER.md](data/processed/SOURCES_EMBER.md), each regenerated by the script that
fetches it.

**Attribution is a licence condition, not a courtesy**, and naming the source is not
enough: CC BY 4.0 §3(1)(a)(ii) requires stating *that* the material was modified, and §4
attaches the condition to derived databases. Those statements are generated on every
ingest and a test fails the build if data is present without them. If you redistribute
data derived from this project, carry the chain forward.

## Known data-quality issues

Published rather than hidden, because a tool that shows 300 confident dots while knowing
some of them are uncertain is overstating what it knows.

One of these is not specific to Türkiye and is worth stating plainly for anyone doing
similar work: **a national grid carbon intensity derived from Climate TRACE's
`electricity-generation` register alone will run high wherever the fleet is substantially
renewable**, because that register is combustion-only. The size of the error tracks the
renewable share, so it is largest in the countries decarbonising fastest. The full
argument, with its measurements, will appear in `METHODOLOGY.md`.

- **80 of 300 facilities** sit within 2 km of a province boundary, were snapped to the
  nearest polygon, or are offshore. Every facility carries a `geocode_quality` flag and
  per-facility distances are in `data/processed/facilities_geocode_report.csv`.
- **Twelve same-subsector near-duplicates**, including four coal-mine pairs at identical
  coordinates and the Kars cement pair 71 m apart whose operators are consistent with one
  plant recorded twice across an ownership change. Unresolved; nothing has been dropped on
  suspicion. See ROADMAP E7.
- **300 records are 290 places.** Climate TRACE lists each oil and gas field twice, under
  production and under transport, at one location. Correct accounting, misleading
  cartography — both counts are reported.
- **One probable province misassignment.** Koç Metalurji Toprakkale was assigned to Hatay
  while two neighbouring plants 600 m away went to Osmaniye. Both are İBBS-2 TR63, so
  regional figures are unaffected.
- **Renewables emit nothing and are therefore not modelled.** Climate TRACE's Turkish power
  register lists combustion plants only. It covers 52% of national generation, and the
  missing half is almost exactly the renewable half — which is why a grid factor computed
  from it alone runs 57% high. The correct denominator comes from Ember instead. The
  missing plants themselves are drawn as an optional **fleet context layer** from GEM —
  3,136 operating plants, 58.8 GW — kept in a separate register (`fleet_renewables.rds`)
  rather than merged into `facilities.rds`, so the 300 modelled facilities stay the 300
  modelled facilities.
- **A Climate TRACE figure is not reproducible without its release tag, and the download
  URL does not carry one.** The bulk packages are served from a `/latest` alias. The two
  packages this project uses were downloaded on the same day and arrived at *different*
  releases — `co2` at v5_9_0, `co2e_100yr` at v5_10_0 — and for the identical 151 Turkish
  power stations, v5_10_0 reports **12.4% more generation in 2024** than v5_9_0. Activity
  is a physical quantity in MWh and does not depend on which gas you asked for, so that is
  a version revision. Every panel row therefore carries a `vintage` column naming its own
  release, and any figure quoted from this project should carry it too.
- **The two populations' 2026 is not the same 2026.** `co2` stops after 5 months,
  `co2e_100yr` after 6. The panel counts months from the data rather than assuming twelve
  and stores the count, because a bar labelled "2026" beside another labelled "2026"
  asserts a comparability that does not hold here. 2026 is never annualised by scaling.
- **Commissioning years come from a spatial join, and 34% of facilities have none.** GEM
  and Climate TRACE are matched by proximity, which is not identity, so every dated
  facility carries `commissioning_source` with the match distance. Three rules keep the
  join honest: zero-carbon plants are excluded from the pool (Climate TRACE's power
  register is combustion-only, so they can never be the right answer), a facility matches
  only a register that covers its own sector, and a GEM site may be claimed by only one
  facility. Aluminium, refining and oil & gas have no GEM tracker at all and carry `NA`
  rather than a borrowed date. An earlier version of this join had none of those rules and
  dated 25 of 235 facilities from small neighbouring solar farms.
- **The İBBS-2 mapping is transcribed, not fetched** from an authoritative file, and
  carries a verification marker pending a citation to the official TÜİK classification.
- **Two carbon price scenarios lack a citation.** `policies/carbon_price_scenarios.json`
  flags them `citation_required: true`. Until that is resolved the project is in breach of
  its own rule that a regulatory number without a source is unusable.
