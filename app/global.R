#
# SCOPE OF THIS VERSION
#   Both populations on one map: 88 industrial installations and 212 energy
#   assets, now over time — `facility_panel.rds` supplies 1,800 facility-years
#   and the time slider drives them.
#
#   Still absent: the CBAM liability figure. The panel's `co2_direct_t` and
#   `co2_indirect_t` columns are deliberately NA pending the direct/indirect
#   decomposition, which is author work (KARBON_ATLASI.md §9). Nothing here
#   fabricates a value to fill that gap, and the interface says so rather than
#   leaving an empty box to be read as zero.
# =============================================================================

# Windows defaults to a non-UTF-8 encoding. Turkish UI labels break silently
# without this, and the failure shows up as mojibake in the browser rather than
# as an error. See KARBON_ATLASI.md §2.

# relative to the project root resolves to app/data/... and fails. Locate the

# colours fail outright on black: coal mining was #4D4D4D, a dark grey that is
# very nearly the basemap itself, and refining was #01665E, dark enough to read
# as a hole rather than a facility. Every hue here sits in the upper half of the
# luminance range so it separates from the ground it is drawn on.

# The warm/cool split survives the move: industrial reds and ambers, energy
# cyans, greens and violets, with coal mining as a light neutral because it is
# the one energy asset that is neither combustion nor extraction of a flowing
# fuel.
# Iron-and-steel and cement were measured too close together at a first pass
# (55 units of RGB distance, both red-orange) and pushed apart: steel toward
# crimson, cement toward amber. They are the two largest industrial sectors and
# sit side by side across the İskenderun and Marmara clusters, so confusing them

# --- Basemap -----------------------------------------------------------------
# NOT CartoDB, and the reason is a defect found by finally looking at the app in
# a browser on 2026-09-01. CARTO now requires an API key for its basemaps and
# serves WATERMARKED tiles without one: every tile carried "API KEY REQUIRED"
# and "carto.com/basemaps/apikey" diagonally across it.
#
# This predates the move to a dark basemap — Positron is the same service and
# the same watermark, so the app had been rendering that way for as long as it
# has had a map. Nobody saw it because nobody had opened it in a browser and
# looked. That is the whole argument for driving the app rather than trusting
# that a reactive returned without error.
#
# Esri's Dark Gray Canvas is free, needs no key, and splits base from labels so
# the labels can sit ABOVE the facility markers — which is better than CARTO
# managed anyway, since a city name under a marker is unreadable. Note the

# 52% of national generation, and this is the half it cannot see.
