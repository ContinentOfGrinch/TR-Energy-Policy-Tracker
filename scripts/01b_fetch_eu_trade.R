# 01b_fetch_eu_trade.R — EU imports of CBAM goods from Türkiye
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
#   Fetch the trade quantities that `eu_export_share` is built from: how much of
#   each CBAM good the EU imported from Türkiye, per year, in tonnes.
#
#   CBAM liability arises only on goods actually exported to the EU. A facility
#   selling entirely into the domestic market has no CBAM exposure. Without this
#   step the tool would be answering "what if every plant exported everything to
#   the EU", which is a different and much weaker question.
#
# NUMBERING
#   `01b` rather than `04` because this is an ACQUISITION step and belongs
#   beside 01_fetch_climate_trace.R, not after 03_build_panel.R which consumes
#   it. Flagged for the author: rename if the convention should be strict.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO
#   It does not decide what `eu_export_share` actually is. Section 5 computes a
#   naive ratio purely as a diagnostic, wrapped in warnings, because the
#   numerator and denominator are NOT measured in the same thing:
#
#     numerator   = EU imports of finished CBAM goods, tonnes of product
#     denominator = Climate TRACE `activity`, tonnes of crude steel / cement /
#                   aluminium produced
#
#   Crude steel is not finished steel: there is yield loss between them, and
#   Annex I does not cover every steel product. Dividing one by the other
#   without a stated conversion is a modelling choice, and it belongs to the
#   author (KARBON_ATLASI.md §9).
