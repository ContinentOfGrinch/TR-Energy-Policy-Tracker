# 02_build_facilities.R — build the time-invariant facility table
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
#   Produce `data/processed/facilities.rds`: one row per facility, carrying only
#   attributes that do not change over time. Anything that varies by year lives
#   in the panel (KARBON_ATLASI.md §6) — putting capacity or status here would
#   break the panel structure.
#
#   The substantive work is deriving province and İBBS-2 (NUTS-2) region from
#   coordinates, since Climate TRACE supplies latitude and longitude but no
#   administrative geography.

# --- GEM enrichment: commissioning year and captive status -------------------
# Climate TRACE begins at 2021 and carries no start year, so the fleet timeline
# depends on matching its facilities to GEM's. Matching is by proximity, and
# proximity is not identity — the match rate and the distance distribution are
# both reported so the join can be judged rather than trusted.
#
# DEFECT FOUND AND FIXED 2026-09-01. The paragraph that used to sit here said
# "only combustion plants and coal mines are matched, GEM's renewables have no
# Climate TRACE counterpart by construction". That was the intent. It was never
# implemented: the pool was the whole of gem_commissioning.csv, of which 3,717
# of 4,174 Turkish rows are solar, wind, hydro, geothermal or nuclear.
#
# Türkiye has 2,944 utility-scale solar plants, many of them sitting on or
# beside the industrial sites this project maps, so "nearest GEM plant within
# 2 km" resolved to a small anonymous solar farm again and again. The result was
# a cement works taking its commissioning year from "Tekirdağ solar project XIV"
# and a steel plant from "Osmaniye solar project II". Nothing errored. The years
# were plausible, the coverage statistic went up, and 25 of 235 matched
# facilities — 10.6% — carried the wrong plant's date.
#
# It surfaced only because the panel gate compared commissioning years against
# the emissions record and found 9 facilities emitting before they existed. That
# check sees just the subset where the wrong plant happened to be newer; the
# rest were silent.
#
# TWO TYPE RULES NOW GOVERN THE POOL, and they are rules rather than thresholds
# because neither involves a judgement about how close is close enough:
#
#   1. Renewables are excluded. Climate TRACE's power register is combustion
#      only (finding E1), so a CT power plant matching a GEM solar farm is
#      impossible by construction, not merely unlikely.
#   2. A facility matches only a register that covers facilities of its kind.
#      A cement works takes its date from the cement tracker, never from the
#      captive power station in its own yard — spatially correct, wrong entity,
#      since the power station's start year is not the cement plant's.
#
# Rule 2 is enforced at SECTOR level, not asset-class level. An asset-class rule
# was tried first and was not enough: it still let a steel plant take its date
# from a cement works 1,484 m away, and it still let three separate refineries
# and power stations all match the single Aliağa EÜAŞ power station. One GEM
# site claimed by several Climate TRACE facilities is the clearest possible
# signal that proximity is not identity.
#
# The consequence is that some sectors have NO eligible register and must carry
# NA. GEM publishes no refinery or oil-and-gas tracker and no aluminium tracker,
# so those facilities get no commissioning year at all. That is the correct
# outcome: §6 requires a facility without a year to carry NA and be visibly
# excluded from the pre-2021 fleet animation, and a wrong year is worse than no
# year precisely because it is invisible.
#
# The distance threshold still matters and is still a judgement call, but it is
# now the last line of defence rather than the only one.

# GEM fuel types with no Climate TRACE counterpart. Matching against these is
# what produced the defect above; they stay in fleet_renewables.rds, which is
