# 03_build_panel.R — build the facility x year emissions panel
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
#   Produce `data/processed/facility_panel.rds`: one row per facility per year,
#   carrying everything that varies over time (KARBON_ATLASI.md §6). The
#   facilities table holds what does not change; this holds what does.
#
#   The substantive work is collapsing MONTHLY source records into annual rows
#   without introducing an error that looks like a number. Climate TRACE
#   publishes one row per facility-month: Turkish cement is 58 facilities x 65
#   months = 3,770 rows. How each variable collapses depends on what kind of
#   quantity it is, and getting that wrong produces a plausible chart rather
#   than an exception.
#

# --- The observed / projected boundary ---------------------------------------
# KARBON_ATLASI.md §5 instructs that Climate TRACE's estimates beyond the last
# observed year enter the panel as `value_type = projected`, drawn dashed and
# badged, never rendered as an observation. It names 2025-2026 as those years.
#
# THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS BOUNDARY WAS LOOKED FOR AND NOT FOUND (2026-09-01).
# Two sources were checked and neither settles it:
#
#   about_the_data.pdf     Describes every column and the licence, and says the
#                          models "provide our current best estimates". It draws
#                          no line between measured and nowcast years.
#   the confidence files   Published per period, but the ratings do not vary by
#                          period. Turkish cement emissions_quantity is "low"
#                          for 9 facilities and "medium" for 49 in 2021 and in
#                          2026 alike. It is a per-facility property replicated
#                          across months, so it carries no temporal signal.
#
# So the boundary is an instruction, not a measurement. It is therefore stated
# ONCE, here, where it can be revised in one edit when the sector methodology
# documents or the upstream changelog settle it. Do not scatter this year
# number through the codebase. See ROADMAP B5.

# 4. COLLAPSE MONTHS TO YEARS
# =============================================================================
# THE CENTRAL DECISION OF THIS SCRIPT. Each variable collapses according to what
# kind of quantity it is, and the three kinds behave differently:
#
#   FLOWS      emissions_quantity, activity. Accumulated over the period, so
#              they SUM. Twelve months of production is the year's production.
#
#   STOCKS     capacity. A plant does not have 12 x 500 MW of capacity in a
#              year; it has 500 MW for twelve months. Summing gives a figure
#              exactly twelve times too large that still renders as a plausible
#              megawatt number. The annual figure is the MEAN of the monthly
#              values — the author's decision, 2026-09-01, on the grounds that
#              it answers "how much capacity existed during that year" and so
#              shows a plant commissioned mid-year at part capacity, which is
#              the correct behaviour for a fleet-turnover animation.
#              `capacity_month_max` is retained so the gate can prove the mean
#              was taken; see gate_panel().
#
#   RATIOS     emission_intensity. RECOMPUTED from the annual totals, as
#              sum(emissions) / sum(activity). It is NOT the mean of the twelve
#              monthly ratios: averaging ratios weights a low-output month
#              equally with a high-output one, which for a seasonal industry
#              like cement biases the result systematically rather than
#              randomly. Same reason a batting average is not the average of
#              monthly averages.
#
# `months_covered` is counted, never assumed. It is a property of the upstream
# release, not of the calendar: the co2 package stops after 5 months of 2026 and
# co2e_100yr after 6, and a version bump changes that without changing any code.
