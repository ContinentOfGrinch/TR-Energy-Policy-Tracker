# =============================================================================
# _validate.R — data quality gates for the pipeline
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOT a numbered pipeline step. Approved as the second exception to the
# numbering convention in KARBON_ATLASI.md §3, alongside `_sources.R`.
# Acquisition and validation are different jobs and belong in different files.
#
# WHY GATES AND NOT ONLY TESTS
#   `tests/` asserts properties of artefacts AFTER they are written. That is
#   useful but late: a bad `facilities.rds` still lands on disk, still gets read
#   by the app, and is only caught if someone remembers to run the suite. These
#   gates run INSIDE the pipeline, before `saveRDS()`, so a build that violates
#   a hard rule produces no artefact at all.
#
# TIERING — the important design decision
#   Not every problem should stop a build.
#
#   STOP   structural impossibilities. A duplicate key, a coordinate outside
#          Türkiye, a missing schema column. These mean the code is wrong, and
#          writing the file would propagate a silent error downstream.
#
#   WARN   data-quality observations. A facility 129 m from a province border,
#          an operator name that could not be resolved. These are properties of
#          the world, not bugs. They must be visible and recorded — never
#          silently swallowed, never fatal.
#
#   The distinction matters because a gate that stops on everything gets
#   disabled within a week, and a gate that warns on everything is ignored.
#
# Usage:
#   source(file.path("scripts", "_validate.R"))
#   gate_facilities(facilities)      # stops on structural failure

# The policy parameter gate
# =============================================================================
# Policy files are hand-edited, and hand-edited JSON drifts. A renamed field, a
# date typed as 19-08-2026, a scope_status quietly changed to something the
# fetch script does not recognise — none of these raise an error at read time.
# They produce NULL, and NULL propagates into a figure.
#
# Two layers, because they catch different things:
#   1. JSON Schema, in policies/_schema/, validates STRUCTURE.
#   2. R checks below validate RELATIONSHIPS between elements, which JSON Schema
#      cannot express — monotonicity of the phase-in, the factor and free
#      allocation summing to one, a scenario having either a source or an
#      admission that it needs one.

POLICY_SCHEMA_DIR <- file.path("policies", "_schema")

#' Read a file as a single UTF-8 string.

#' also keeps jsonvalidate from having to guess what it was handed.

#' containing raw UTF-8 Turkish characters fails intermittently on Windows with
#' `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` — a message that names neither the
#' file nor the field. It reproduced under `testthat` and not outside it, which
#' makes it an encoding-handoff problem somewhere in the R → V8 boundary rather
#' than a defect in the documents.
#'
#' `\uXXXX` escaping is part of the JSON specification, so the escaped text is
#' the same document by any conforming parser. Escaping removes the ambiguity
#' instead of depending on every layer agreeing about encoding.
#'
#' Handles the Basic Multilingual Plane, which covers all Turkish characters.

#' appears in a policy file this must be extended rather than silently mangling.
