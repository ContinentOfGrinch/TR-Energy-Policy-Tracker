# Climate TRACE and GEM both publish under CC BY 4.0. Attribution is a term of
# that licence, so redistributing derived data without it is a breach, not an
# oversight. These tests exist because "remember to credit GEM" is exactly the
# kind of obligation that survives a conversation and not a codebase.
#
# Each test skips when the artefact it guards has not been produced yet, so a
# fresh clone stays green before the pipeline has run.
