# test-facilities.R — properties of data/processed/facilities.rds

# These began as an ad-hoc verification script run once by hand. Made permanent
# because the two worst bugs found in this project so far — a name-shadowing
# mutate() that tripled a denominator, and a project-root marker that silently
# broke the app after a rename — both produced correct-looking output and no
# error. Assertions are the only thing that catches that class of failure.
