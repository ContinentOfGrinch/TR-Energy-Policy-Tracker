# test-palette.R — can the map's colours actually be seen on the map?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The app draws on CartoDB.DarkMatter. A colour chosen against a white editor
# background can be invisible on it, and nothing in the pipeline would notice:
# the marker renders, the legend renders, the facility is simply not there to
# the eye. This is the only failure mode in the project that no data check can
# catch, because the data is correct.
#
# Measured rather than judged. The first pass of the dark palette failed three
# of these — coal mining had been #4D4D4D, near-black on near-black, and two
# renewable fuels fell below threshold once their 55% opacity was accounted for.
#
# Thresholds:
#   3.0   WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11, the minimum contrast for a non-text graphical
#         object against its background.
#   60    Euclidean RGB distance between two categorical colours. Not a
#         standard; a floor established by measurement here, below which
#         iron-and-steel and cement were confusable in the İskenderun cluster
#         where they sit side by side.
# =============================================================================

# DarkMatter's land polygons sit around this value. Water is darker, so this is
# the harder of the two grounds and the right one to test against.

#' Load app/global.R into an isolated environment.
#'
#' Two pieces of global state have to be restored afterwards, and the second one
#' cost a debugging round:
#'
#'   working directory  global.R resolves paths from it, so it is changed rather
#'                      than assumed, then put back.
#'
#'   options(encoding)  global.R sets it to "UTF-8" for the app's own sake (§2).
#'                      That is a PROCESS-WIDE setting, and leaving it changed
#'                      broke jsonvalidate in a later test file: V8 reads its own
#'                      bundle.js through readLines() and threw "SyntaxError:
#'                      Invalid or unexpected token" from inside the package,
#'                      naming neither this file nor the option. The same V8
#'                      encoding trap the project already documents, reached by
#'                      a new route. testthat runs files alphabetically, so
#'                      `palette` leaks into `validate-gates`.
